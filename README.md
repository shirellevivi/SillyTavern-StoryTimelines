### Opening the Timeline

- **Via Extensions Menu**: Click the clock icon in the extensions menu
- **Via Slash Command**: Type `/loretimeline` in the chat input

### Tagging Lorebook Entries

1. Open the Lorebook Timeline panel

6. Click **"Save Tag"**

### Viewing Different Time Scales

- **All Time**: See all events in one list
- **By Year**: Events grouped by year
- **By Month**: Events grouped by month
- **By Week**: Events grouped by week
- **By Day**: Events grouped by day
- **By Hour**: Events grouped by hour

This is especially useful for long timelines spanning centuries or for detailed hour-by-hour event sequences.

### Reordering Events

With drag & drop enabled (default):
1. Open the Lorebook Timeline panel
2. Click and drag any entry
3. Drop it on another entry to swap their story times
4. Changes are saved automatically

### Exporting Timeline

Click the **Export Timeline** button to generate a markdown file containing:
- All tagged entries in chronological order
- Formatted with dates, keywords, and content
- Perfect for reference or sharing with others

### Settings

Access settings by clicking the gear icon in the Timeline panel or using `/loretimeline`:

- **Show Timeline Icon**: Toggle visibility of the timeline button in extensions menu
- **Enable Drag & Drop**: Allow/prevent reordering entries via drag & drop
- **Auto Refresh**: Automatically update timeline when switching lorebooks
- **Date/Time Format**: Choose between 12-hour (AM/PM) or 24-hour time format

## Data Structure

The extension adds a custom field to lorebook entries:

```javascript
{
  "uid": 1703001234567,
  "key": ["Kingdom of Mossford", "Mossford"],
  "comment": "Founding of Mossford",
  "content": "The Kingdom of Mossford was founded...",
  "extensions": {
    "storytimelines": {
      "storyTime": "1247-03-15T14:00:00.000Z",
      "dateOnly": false
    }
  }
}
```

This data is saved directly to your lorebook JSON files and persists between sessions.

## Example Timeline

Here's how you might organize a fantasy world's history:

```
Year 1247
  ├─ March 15: Founding of Mossford Kingdom
  └─ August 3: First Dragon Sighting

Year 1248
  ├─ January 12: The Great Winter begins
  └─ December 25: Discovery of Ancient Ruins

Year 1250
  └─ June 7: War of the Three Kingdoms starts
```
